## Soldering details

Unfortunately I chose a relatively low-cost soldering iron --> Parkside Soldering Iron PLS 48 D2 - roughly around 25 EUR. I must note that at the end of the build, my soldering iron had no pointy (metal) edge left!

Excellent (generic) soldering tips can be found in [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/rossmanngroup/playlists) youtube channel of Louis Rossmann.

A more targeted tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cRJV1jo5vao), from JUJU.
